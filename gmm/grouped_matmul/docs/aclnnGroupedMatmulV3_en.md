## Function

- Description: Performs grouped matrix multiplication, where the dimension sizes of each group can differ. The basic function is matrix multiplication, as in $y_i[m_i,n_i]=x_i[m_i,k_i] \times weight_i[k_i,n_i], i=1...g$, where g is the number of groups and $m_i/k_i/n_i$ are the corresponding shapes. Both input and output data types are aclTensorList, and the corresponding functions are:

  - k-axis grouping: $k_i$ values differ, but $m_i/n_i$ are the same for each group. In this case, $x_i/weight_i$ can be concatenated along $k_i$.
  - m-axis grouping: $k_i$ is the same across groups, and $weight_i/y_i$ can be concatenated along $n_i$.

  Compared with the [aclnnGroupedMatmul](aclnnGroupedMatmul_en.md) API, **this API adds the following:**

    <!-- npu="A3,910b" id7 -->
    - <term>Atlas A2 products</term>, <term>Atlas A3 products</term>:
      - In non-quantization scenarios, weight transpose is supported (transpose refers to the scenario where, if the shape is [M,K], the stride is [1,M] and the data layout is [K,M]).
      - Supports m-axis and k-axis grouping, indicated by groupType.
      - When x, weight, and y are all single tensors, in non-quantization scenarios, both x and weight inputs of float32 type are supported.
      - In quantization and pseudo-quantization scenarios, weight transposition is supported, and weight as a single tensor is supported.
      - For the features supported by the [aclnnGroupedMatmul](aclnnGroupedMatmul_en.md) API, this API does not support the use case where x is a single tensor and weight/y are multiple tensors.

    <!-- npu="950" id8 -->
    - <term>Ascend 950PR&950DT products</term>:
      - In pseudo-quantization scenarios, weight transposition is supported, and x, weight, and y as single tensors are all supported.
      - For features supported by the [aclnnGroupedMatmul](aclnnGroupedMatmul_en.md) API, this API does not support the use case where x is a single tensor and weight/y are multiple tensors.

    <!-- end id8 -->

**NOTE**

  - Single tensor means that all grouped tensors in a tensor list are merged into one on the grouping axis specified by groupType; otherwise, it is multi-tensor.
  - Tensor transposition: refers to the scenario where the tensor shape is [M, K], the stride is [1, M], and the data layout is [K, M], i.e., a non-contiguous tensor.

  - Formula:
    - **Non-quantized scenario:**

      $$
       y_i=x_i\times weight_i + bias_i
      $$

    - **Quantization scenario:**

      $$
       y_i=(x_i\times weight_i + bias_i) * scale_i + offset_i
      $$

    - **Dequantized scenario:**

      $$
       y_i=(x_i\times weight_i + bias_i) * scale_i
      $$

    - **Pseudo-Quantized Scenario:**

      $$
       y_i=x_i\times (weight_i + antiquant\_offset_i) * antiquant\_scale_i + bias_i
      $$

## Function Prototype

Each operator uses a [two-phase API](../../../docs/en/context/two_phase_api.md). Call the "aclnnGroupedMatmulV3GetWorkspaceSize" API first to obtain the input parameters and calculate the required workspace size based on the calculation process. Then call the "aclnnGroupedMatmulV3" API to perform the computation.

```cpp
aclnnStatus aclnnGroupedMatmulV3GetWorkspaceSize(
  const aclTensorList   *x,
  const aclTensorList   *weight,
  const aclTensorList   *biasOptional,
  const aclTensorList   *scaleOptional,
  const aclTensorList   *offsetOptional,
  const aclTensorList   *antiquantScaleOptional,
  const aclTensorList   *antiquantOffsetOptional,
  const aclTensor       *groupListOptional,
  int64_t                splitItem,
  int64_t                groupType,
  const aclTensorList   *y,
  uint64_t              *workspaceSize,
  aclOpExecutor         **executor)
```

```cpp
aclnnStatus aclnnGroupedMatmulV3(
  void          *workspace,
  uint64_t       workspaceSize,
  aclOpExecutor *executor,
  aclrtStream    stream)
```

- If groupListOptional is passed in, groupListOptional must be a monotonically non-decreasing sequence of non-negative numbers.
- The size of each dimension of each group of tensors in x and weight, after 32-byte alignment, must be less than the maximum int32 value 2147483647.

    - The input types of x, weight, and y are aclTensorList, which represents an array object of the aclTensor type. In the following table of supported scenarios, "single" indicates an aclTensorList consisting of one aclTensor, and "multiple" indicates an aclTensorList consisting of multiple aclTensors. For example, "single-multiple-single" means that x is a single tensor, weight is multiple tensors, and y is a single tensor.

  - The last dimension of each group of tensors in x and weight must be less than 65536. The last dimension of $x_i$ refers to the K-axis of $x_i$ when x is not transposed, or the M-axis of $x_i$ when x is transposed. The last dimension of $weight_i$ refers to the N-axis of $weight_i$ when weight is not transposed, or the K-axis of $weight_i$ when weight is transposed.

  - Supported scenarios for different groupType values:
    - In the supported scenarios, "single" indicates a single tensor, "multiple" indicates multiple tensors, and the order is x, weight, y. For example, "single-multiple-single" indicates a scenario where x is a single tensor, weight consists of multiple tensors, and y is a single tensor.
